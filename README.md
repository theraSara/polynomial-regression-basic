# Machine Learning with Arduino: Quadratic Model Fitting for Sensor Data

This project demonstrates the implementation of a machine learning algorithm for quadratic model fitting using an Arduino. It collects data from sensors, trains a model, and performs predictions to control output devices based on the estimated values.

## State Machine

The system operates based on the following states:

1. **Idle**: Waits for user input to begin training or enter testing mode.
2. **TrainingStart**: Collects training data from sensors and users.
3. **CollectingDataOnEntry**: Increments the data count.
4. **CollectingDataOnStay**: Records sensor and control values.
5. **FitModel**: Performs quadratic regression to fit the model.
6. **CollectX**: Reads new sensor data.
7. **CalculateY**: Predicts control values using the trained model.
8. **UpdateControlOnEntry/Stay**: Updates the control output based on predictions.
9. **CollectTestData**: Collects data for model testing.
10. **EstimateY**: Calculates the predicted control value during testing.
11. **AccumError**: Updates error metrics for performance evaluation.
12. **ShowError**: Displays the performance metrics.

## Performance Metrics

- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: Average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Square root of MSE, indicating the standard deviation of errors.
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Average absolute difference between actual and predicted values.
- **R² (Coefficient of Determination)**: Proportion of variance explained by the model.

## Model Training and Testing

The data is divided into training and testing sets based on a specified portion (`TestingPortion`). Matrix operations are used for model fitting, including:

1. **Transpose Matrix**
2. **Matrix Multiplication**
3. **Matrix Inversion**

The weights of the quadratic model (`w`) are calculated using these operations. The testing set is then used to evaluate the model's performance.

## Code Overview

### Main Functions

1. **`setup()`**: Initializes pins, begins serial communication, and optionally runs training in debug mode.
2. **`loop()`**: Handles the state machine transitions and operations based on user input and sensor data.
3. **`QuadraticModelFitting()`**: Fits a quadratic model to the training data using matrix operations.
4. **`performanceReport()`**: Calculates and displays performance metrics.
5. **`train_test_split()`**: Splits data into training and testing sets.
6. **`delayG(int time)`**: Implements non-blocking delays.

### Debugging Mode

When `DebugAIMode` is set to `true`, detailed outputs are printed to the serial monitor, including:

- Training data
- Model weights
- Performance metrics

## Requirements

- **Hardware**: Arduino (e.g., Uno), sensors, and output devices (e.g., LEDs, motors).
- **Software**: Arduino IDE.
